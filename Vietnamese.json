It is a heavily modified version of our pre-civilized bodies. It provides good mobility, easy adaptation and is easy to fix.\n\nIn case of disaster we can back up our data patterns to a sanctuary site for later retrieval. Storage in this fashion is safe provided consistent power supply, however unique perspectives and traits which arose from the interplay with the original medium are lost. It is like a factory reset.\n\nIt is recommended individuals be restored to a compatible medium as soon as possible.

No living member of their species has ever been encountered. We have nonetheless learned a great deal about them from what they left behind.\nTheir architecture suggests they are roughly 50% larger than humans, and non-bipedal. It is unclear whether they interact with their technologies through naturally or artificially developed sensory apparatus, but it is clear they had mastered the complexities of genetic and technological alteration.\nOf most interest is their use of sanctuary sites around the planet. Our efforts to decipher the data stored there have been in vain, but evidence suggests they were used for emergency shelter when the Kharaa bacterium was first released. The aliens must somehow be able to download their minds to databanks for later retrieval.\nThis suggests their relationship with their corporeal bodies is quite different from our own.

They have not become inanimate parts in a larger consciousness, nor ascended to a non-physical form of existence. In short, they have somehow maintained a level of individuality - as evidenced in translated logs - yet they are connected with one another and their world in a way we can only imagine.\nThe distress signal has gone dim, but we will keep monitoring the Phi teleporter site for activity.

The Aurora has reportedly now missed more than one routine check in.\n\nAsked for comment, a spokesperson for Alterra said, 'Communication with ships outside of the phase gate network can take weeks or months in ordinary circumstances, and is commonly interrupted. The Aurora was in good shape and ahead of schedule the last time they checked in, we have no reason to think anything has changed.'\n\nNonetheless our sources emphasize that Alterra cannot yet explain the loss of contact, and given the exceptional value of the ship and its mission they are taking every possible measure to re-establish contact. Shareholders will be watching closely.\n\nKeen readers will remember, however, that Alterra's network of directors have a history of leaking scare stories like this to the press, only for the trans-gov to rebound with positive news against the odds. Director's shareholdings and dealings are of course not public information.",

The transmission came from trade ship Sunbeam, which was passing nearby when it detected their SOS.\n\n'Hey Alterra, we've got one of your birds in the soup over here. Looks like they took *Static* survivors. We're moving in for a closer look.'\n\nWhile the number of survivors is not yet known, nor the true state of the ship, it is now known that she has landed with her hull largely intact, on planet 4546B. Smaller than earth and largely water-bound, it is thought the planet has a breathable atmosphere, and hopes have been raised all around.\n\nThe Sunbeam is registered as a 5-seater cargo vessel, insufficient to evacuate the crew or cargo of the Aurora, but perhaps enough to assess the situation and reassure shareholders at home that their investment is secure.\n\nThere is at least a one month delay on transmissions from that region of space. In the meantime Alterra is working on every possible solution, including an innovative idea to transmit the blueprints for a purpose built rocket which could be constructed using materials salvaged from the Aurora, and the planet itself. If the crew could begin their long journey home now the rescue teams could meet them halfway, shaving months off their return.\n\nAlterra share prices rose to their quarterly high on the news.",

The mandibles open up while the backward facing teeth dig into flesh and prevent easy escape. The prey is pulled towards the chelicerate's mouth and devoured.\r\n\r\nExoskeleton: The chelicerate\u2019s body is made of a thick segmented exoskeleton. The exoskeleton grows in flexible overlapping plates. This provides protection from the atmospheric pressure while giving the chelicerate the maneuverability to easily pursue prey. \r\n\r\nBehaviors: The chelicerate is a predatory animal that patrols the warmer waters found near thermal vents. It can be seen feeding upon other predators and fish.\r\n\r\nAs it attacks, the chelicerate emits a loud screech that disorients its prey. In smaller fish, it can temporarily stun them, which gives the chelicerate more time to attack. \r\n\r\nVoid Chelicerate: The Void Chelicerate is a rare mutation of the chelicerate that prefers to roam in dark, open waters at the edge of the sector. \r\n\r\nAssessment: Avoid - aggressive and potentially lethal.",

She is strong willed and seems cold upon initial contact.\r\n\r\nHistory: Not much is known about Marguerit. She was born and raised in the Mongolian States, a backwater corporate colony exploited for its mineral resources. She left home at sixteen and went from one mercenary job to another. Eventually, she did tours with the Mongolian Defense Force and Trans-System Federation. She held an esteemed career, before being dishonorably discharged from the TSF for going off mission. \r\n\r\nThe details are unclear, but our resources have unearthed some scant details. Marguerit was the head of an intel and reconnaissance mission. We aren\u2019t clear what she stumbled upon, but she silently eliminated the entire local security apparatus over the course of three days. None of the local families would give more information. They only said they thanked \u201cGod\u2019s Hand\u201d for saving them.\r\n  \r\nHer last mission was aboard the Degasi as private security against potential pirates and scavengers, which crashed on 4546B.",

We're still XenoWorx. We're not going to move offices, or start having some kind of hierarchical structure, or even like... making you show up on site or anything like that. (Although you should, for the snacks alone.) We're still the scrappy, agile, research-first, startup you all signed onto.\n\nSo what does this \"controlling stake\" stuff MEAN?\n\nWell... I guess the most direct way to put it is it means MORE. More equipment. More research. More risk. More experimentation. More of everything that makes us great. And most of all, MORE CASH. For you and your research. (And yes, snacks.)\n\nLina will be in touch pretty soon about exchanging your old gen XenoWorks PDAs for snazzy new Alterra upgrades, and to help you get comfy with some really minor policy changes that are going to help us keep everything running nice and smooth going forward.\n\nSo yeah... Congratulations everyone! We did this together, and now we're going to be able to do so much more.\n\nCheers!\nIsis Jacks\nCommunications Specialist\nXenoWorx",

I damn near carved out the other. We were headed for the void at the crater's edge. Blinded, she was spiralling deeper. I had a choice. Hold on or let go. I clung for dear life as she took us deeper.\nI had one minute of air in the tank. Back then I could go another three with what I had in my lungs. So I had four minutes to kill the reaper, minus a few to get back to the surface. It ain't that I like killing folk. It's just sometimes what you need is on the inside of someone else's ribcage.\nI killed that beautiful, terrifying creature and I made for the surface.

It had taken hours for the reaper's corpse to float to the surface.\nUsing the knife, I clambered up her flank and got a perch up on top. I figured she'd float for a few days at least.

At least I wasn't going to die of exhaustion.\nNow those reapers, they're practically all muscle, but there's some fat in there.  I was able to keep warm and drink the water.\nAnd I didn't have much, but I had that repair tool, so I had a spark. It took a week to light that first fire.

Swimming birds usually means solid land of some kind. I was lucky. The winds followed their path. Hours later, I saw a blessed sight: an unmoving cloud, sitting upon the water. Land.\nIt renewed my spirit as I watched the land get closer and closer. The reaper slowly sank, but I was no longer worried.

These arms contain independent high speed computing systems and are capable of performing tasks independently. \n\nLimbs: The organic arms are considered secondary to the inorganic robotic arms. These are used for mundane tasks that don't require much fine motor movement. The bottom half of the arms are covered in a biocomposite plating. The plating might serve as a form of armor. It also appears to store latent energy buildups like capacitors.  \n\nMobility: The hooved legs are reminiscent of several species of mountain goats.

The forelegs and the hindlegs are oddly close together, which explains why walking might be a secondary mode of movement for this Architect form.\n\nTeleportation:  This Architect body is able to teleport or \u201cblink\u201d short distances.

An invasive species known for their extremely tough skin, which makes them hard to eradicate.\n- Putty Serpent of Apostikar. This snake has extremely tensile skin. Prevents it from tearing and allows it to compress itself into small spaces.\n- Electrode Eel of Lithton. Generates an electrically charged slime across its length. \n- Astral Rays. Moons of Mardon-14. These rays have small organs that generate and store electricity.\n- Shaggy Goats of Olympion. These herbivorous creatures live on the rocky foothills of the mountain planet Olympion and are excellent climbers.\n- Giant Geckos of Holt\u2019s Asteroid.

Having \u201ckept so many warm,\u201d Hope might be observed to produce exothermic chemical reactions.\r\n\r\nAssessment:  find and maintain Hope.",

I don\u2019t know any weapon system with that level of capability. The power source to get that kind of range must be, well...otherworldly. We got lucky. The energy signature is similar to some of the weaponry meant to counter pirates on mining freighters.\nThe refraction of the beam across the atmosphere...Orion\u2019s Belt, it looked like the Northern Lights. Such power. I fired the emergency flares and dumped water from the nuclear core. I think the heat signature confused the weapon\u2019s tracking for just an instant.\nI managed a slight evasive maneuver and I felt the Mercury get rocked by the sonic boom as the nuclear runoff rapidly evaporated. That alone could\u2019ve taken us out. Definitely asking for a pay raise. This is not what I signed up for, my days of risky missions should be behind me. But what the hell, I still got it...even it was luck. Hopefully whatever didn\u2019t want us on the planet doesn\u2019t mind when we leave.",

Orion\u2019s belt, I would be an absolute fool!\nWe\u2019ve done some scans and while there aren\u2019t a lot of mineral resources on this planet, there is decent biodiversity. Teams go out in the morning. This should be a significant specimen and sample haul for biopatenting. Which will be split among the crew as part of the discovery clause. Let\u2019s see Stefanos and everyone else complain when they have a few more Sol-Transgov credits in their uniform pockets. They\u2019ll learn to trust my instincts at some point.",

Between these tunneling creatures and the strange sickness that a few of the crew are showing symptoms of... we have to leave at first light tomorrow.\nWe are prepping for a rapid takeoff. We can\u2019t take chances with the vibrations drawing the tunnelers, so we\u2019re skipping the systems check. Risky, but I have faith in myself and the crew of the Mercury. Landing this thing was practically a miracle though...but we have to get out of here. Maybe the weapon is to keep people away, but if we leave...it\u2019ll let us go.\n...I have to leave the quarantined crew in the cave behind. We will be back for them, but we can\u2019t risk an unknown infection spreading through the Mercury. We\u2019re packing survival kits for them, but there\u2019s only enough surplus for about two weeks. I\u2019m telling them that we will come back, but I don\u2019t think I can land here safely... twice. I hate this, but I have to leave them behind. I can\u2019t risk the entirety of the Mercury.",

The images are a little degraded coming through the atmosphere, but it looks like intentional and complex architecture, which means civilization, and civilization means *trumpet fanfare* language! Aw, man! Now, most of the crew just wants to get home, I understand that, but this could be a defining discovery. I am definitely going to put a bug in Diana\u2019s ear about going to the surface, so I can take a team to explore. I desperately hope this pans out.\nUgh, I can\u2019t wait until we get into communication range with Sol again. Laila and the kids would love to hear this.

It was highly unlikely that another colony would be out this far. We were going to be in the freaking history books.\nEverything was going ok. We were a few miles from the ship when our radios picked up an actual signal! It sounded like an SOS...we got overly excited naturally, and decided to enter the water to follow it. That decision cost three lives. I mean, half my team! They got ripped to shreds by...something. They died, screaming...alone in the cold dark waters. I...I\u2019m not going back in that god-forsaken ocean again, I refuse.\nSome of the animals on this planet, they look sick too. Weird pustules on the skin. Oddly sluggish. I think we should leave, but Diana said we should stay. She thinks the biopatent payoffs will be worth it, but...but those families will never see their loved ones again...they don\u2019t care about no payoffs! We can\u2019t return the bodies! I don\u2019t care about the accolades or the history books. I just want to see Laila and the kids. Oh man...I miss the smell of my wife's hair...the kids tackling me at the door again.

Then I helped with the scavenging, chopped some veggies with the cooks, and tried to help Diana, but she sent me down to engineering with Stefanos. I\u2019ve been working with him the last few days.\nStefanos, how to describe Stefanos. He\u2019s by far the most thorough engineer I\u2019ve worked with, and no ego. He never leaves a job undone, no matter how late it is. I've never seen him awake before 11 and he always greets me by saying, \u201cKalimera, Yasmine,\u201d in the sleepiest drawl - not a morning person that one, haha. He listens with the slightest smile on his face, and twirls this stray curl by his ear. He asks a billion questions, but I don\u2019t mind.\nHe surprised me today! There\u2019s an empty room on the bridge, just a spot of negative space in the ship. He set a picnic there and said I need to relax. He even called me a busybody! There were these crazy glowing fungus things he found to set the ambience. The most exciting part though\u2026*drum roll*\nHe can jailbreak fabricators! He made a small batch of traditional Grecian dishes, BUT the craziest part? He managed to make a suitable falafel for me!? I never thought I\u2019d see GOOD falafel in deep space, Al\u2019humdu\u2019allah. A quiet genius that one. This planet may be a cold mistress, but...maybe it isn\u2019t so bad.",

I was helping the bridge crew with the emergency takeoff, since the crew is...well, was shorthanded, because of everything.\nI heard the sound of metal tearing and for a split second... everything was tinged bright green and unbearably hot. Then I saw daylight and I was looking down at the ocean and ice. The strongest wind I\u2019ve ever felt roared in my ears, ripping through the ship. People went flying out the side of the Mercury, so much screaming and chaos. I was lucky, I had just clipped into my seat anchor.\nStefanos came out of nowhere, like a malaikah, an angel. I felt his rough calloused hand grasp mine with the gentlest of urgency. It felt like time slowed. He said, \u201cI gotcha, just follow me, ela.\u201d I don\u2019t know how, but he used an emergency tether to drag me to the nuclear reactor core...the strongest bulkhead in the ship. We hit the water and everything went black.\nHe\u2019s sleeping, I think he might\u2019ve hit his head. I\u2019m exhausted, the adrenaline has long since worn off and my body aches. I think I might\u2019ve fractured a rib. I'm gonna shut my eyes for a bit. When I wake up...I\u2019ll figure this out. I\u2019ll save us.",

Apapa, I didn\u2019t go to school for eight years and get three degrees for nothing!\nI tried to convince Diana that we don\u2019t need to stop for repairs. That\u2019s what the drift drive and secondary propulsion system are for. It\u2019s just a bit slower, but she\u2019s in charge, not me.\nOn the plus side, I get to work with Yasmine! I didn\u2019t know she was such a busy body. She\u2019s been going around the whole ship giving folks a hand. I think she was getting on Diana\u2019s nerves, so she assigned Yasmine to me.\nShe\u2019s helping me inspect and repair the thruster systems. I thought I was the most mechanically inclined person on the ship, but I think she has me beat.

They were hypothermic and frostbitten, because they walked back to avoid \"angering them.\" The ice shelf is probably a bit unstable and they got disoriented or something.\nTo borrow from Diana... \"Orion\u2019s belt... Thermal couplings are not meant to be worked on in twenty-minute spurts. If we break the process, we'll break the ship.\"\nBut, it is nice to hang out with Yasmine while we wait for the rumbles to stop. I hope she doesn\u2019t mind all my questions. I love hearing her voice.\nHer face lights up and she\u2019s got the most expressive eyebrows! They\u2019re practically acrobats. The way she looks when talking about nuclear engineering is the same way I look at my grandmother\u2019s dolmades.\nThe woman never sits down though! She told me that she used to do decathalon in college and I can believe it. She\u2019s like a bouncy ball, just all over the place. She makes rounds on the ship everyday to see if people need help. Hmm... I should do something nice for her. She\u2019s always helping everyone else. I wish I had a fraction of her energy!",
